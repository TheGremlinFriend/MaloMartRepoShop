# MaloMartRepoShop
Replaces the Shop music in Repo with the music from Malo Mart in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess

#####   I'm new-ish to github so I am unsure if I'm doing things right. 
######   I wanted to have Malo Mart Music from Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess in a game. I was able to find two mods that worked well in game but unfortunatly they needed to be manually added to the mod folder. That usually wouldn't matter for me. But I was trying to update a modpack that is used for multiplayer games with friends. So I wanted something as simple as possible. Since I'm still new to all of this I looked at other files from music replacement mods that worked how I needed and attempted to recreate that with the Malo Mart music instead. 
#####   Hopefully it works and I did things correctlly...?
