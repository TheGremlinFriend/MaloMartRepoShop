Replaces the Shop music in Repo with the music from Malo Mart in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess

I'm new to git hub so I am unsure if I'm doing things right. I wanted to have Malo Mart Music from Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess in the game Repo. But the two mods that I found that replace the music weren't working once loaded into the game. I looked at other files from shop music replacement mods that worked for me and attempted to recreate that with the Malo Mart music instead. I just wanted to upload it to Thunderstore so I could throw the mod into a multiplayer file for friends, which has lead me to GitHub. Hopefully it works and I did things correctly.
