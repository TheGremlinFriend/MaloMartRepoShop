# MaloMartRepoShop
Replaces the Shop music in Repo with the music from Malo Mart in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess

#####  This is my first time working with any sort of mods that aren't quick recolors of things or mesh updates in Blender. I did find two other REPO shop music replacers with this song, but unfortunately they only seemed to work when I manually installed them. I was looking for one that would work just using the install option in a Mod Manager so I started this project....
######  Hopefully it works and I did things correctly...?

### Changelog
#### 1.0.1 
  + Attempted to fix file structure for replacement to work with install using Mod Manager as originally intended
#### 1.0.0
  + Initial Release
